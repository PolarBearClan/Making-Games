This is Making Games 2024!

Guidline

Commits should be short and concise like e.g "Add fix for dark mode toggle state" to show intent of commit code.

Task estimation every monday after class to estimate size of features/tasks from backlog.

Main is for major changes and build the game for release, dev is for minor and patches and branches are for issues.

x: MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
y: MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
z: PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Scenes: create a scene for your own issue if neccesary. There should be a main scene for the acutal gameplay/level designer.

Scenes should be created as a collection for a specific feature.

Prefabs are awesome! Should be a folder for its own.
